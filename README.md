# pqmsg

Tiny private messages on Ethereum, with a post-quantum key exchange.

pqmsg stores every message publicly on-chain, yet only the two ends of a conversation can read it, and the chain doesn't show who is talking to whom. Each conversation's key travels encrypted with Kyber512, a lattice-based scheme designed to resist quantum computers, and a zero-knowledge proof made in your browser shows it was encrypted correctly. Every key comes from one passkey, made when you join.

**Why it matters.** Whatever goes on a public chain stays there forever. Messages encrypted to today's elliptic-curve keys can be harvested now and decrypted once a large quantum computer exists. pqmsg is a working testbed for private messaging on a public chain without that expiry date, and it's explicit about the parts that aren't post-quantum yet (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

Status: Phase 1, on the Sepolia testnet. A research prototype, not audited.

Terms are defined in `GLOSSARY.md`; key decisions are in `docs/adr/`. What the OpenChannel proof checks, and how post-quantum pqmsg is, is in `docs/security/open-channel-proof.md`.

## How it works

1. Users connect their wallet and register a User Key, a Kyber512 public key derived from their Sender Key, which comes from a passkey they make when joining (ADR-0004).
2. Registered Users are shown in a list, and the sender picks a recipient.
3. The sender opens a Channel to them. Its Channel Key is H(Sender Key, recipient's User Index), and the Sender Key comes from the sender's passkey (ADR-0004). The sender encrypts it to the recipient's User Key (Kyber512 CPA-PKE, uncompressed), and the circuit proves that the Channel Key hashes to the Channel Key Hash and that the Encrypted Channel Key encrypts it. The User Key is a private input, so the recipient stays hidden (ADR-0003). The recipient finds the Channel by decrypting every Encrypted Channel Key and checking each result against its Channel Key Hash, and learns who opened it from the Encrypted Sender. Nothing is shared out of band.
4. To send a message, the sender derives the Message Key = H(Channel Key, Message Index) and the Message ID = H(Message Key, 0). The message's two 31-byte halves become the two Ciphertext Elements by adding H(Message Key, 1) and H(Message Key, 2) respectively (hash and add). In Phase 1 this happens outside the circuit.
5. The contract stores the two Ciphertext Elements as u256 values in a publicly readable hashmap keyed by Message ID. The recipient finds messages by checking Message IDs from Message Index 0 upward.

A Fixed Sender (a stand-in for a future relayer) submits Channel openings and messages, so they don't reveal who is talking. Registration comes from the user's own wallet.

Contract stores:
1. List of registered Users with their User Key (an 800-byte packed Kyber512 public key).
2. Channels array: each Channel's Channel Key Hash, Encrypted Channel Key and Encrypted Sender.
3. Messages: hashmap of Message ID to the two Ciphertext Elements.

It emits `Registered(user)`, `ChannelOpened(channelKeyHash)` and `Posted(messageId)`, each indexed.

Right after you open a Channel, and under each message you sent from this browser, the app links the transaction on Etherscan, which shows only the Fixed Sender calling PqMsg.

Deep dive mode (🤿 in the header) explains each step as it happens: what ran in the browser, the circuit and on-chain, the values involved (secrets hidden until tapped), and what to watch out for. It's a sidebar on desktop and sits below the page on phones.

## CROPS

pqmsg leads with **privacy**: only a Channel's two ends can read it, even with a future quantum computer, and the chain never shows who is talking to whom.

- **Censorship resistant.** PqMsg has no allowlist, and its owner can only swap the Verifier. The Fixed Sender can refuse to send, but `openChannel` and `post` take calls from any wallet, at the cost of showing who sent them.
- **Open source.** MIT-licensed. Everything builds from this repo: `yarn circuits:build` builds the circuit, Verifier and WASM prover, `yarn deploy` the contracts, and `yarn start` the app.
- **Private.** The chain shows only the Fixed Sender opening Channels and posting ciphertexts (ADR-0003). The RPC server sees your address and which messages you read, but not whom you open a Channel to, as their User Key comes over Anon-RPC (`docs/anon-rpc.md`). The app has no trackers or analytics.
- **Secure.** Channel Keys are encrypted to Kyber512 keys, with a Groth16 proof that each encryption is well formed, though its setup is dev-only. Your Sender Key, kept only in memory, comes from a passkey that only answers pqmsg's own domain. Channel Keys stay in this browser's storage unencrypted, and "Find my chats" restores them.

## Run locally

You need Node 20.18.3 or later, Yarn through Corepack, and Foundry. Go 1.26 is needed only to rebuild the circuit; its built files are committed.

```sh
yarn install
yarn chain    # anvil, in its own terminal
yarn deploy   # the Verifier and PqMsg, on anvil
yarn start    # the app, at http://localhost:3000
```

To change the circuit, run `yarn circuits:build`. It runs a fresh setup, so it regenerates `Verifier.sol` and the proving key together, and you redeploy afterwards. `sh packages/circuits/build.sh wasm` rebuilds only the WASM and the WebGPU bundle, and keeps the setup.

## Test

```sh
yarn test                                 # PqMsg, with a real proof
(cd packages/circuits && go test ./...)   # the circuit's proofs and rejections, Kyber, the hashes
yarn next:lint && yarn next:check-types
```

CI runs only the lint and type checks so far.
